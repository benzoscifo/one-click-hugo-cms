## Understanding the problem

First of all, it is really important to understand and agree on the problem and the objective of the project.

With FEN being carbon footprint experts, we ran a workshop with them to understand the full problem and learn what we need to do, to accurately measure businesses’ CO2 emissions.

By the end of the workshop, we agreed on what we were trying to achieve, and what we had to deliver before the Sustainability Festival on the 17th of September.

We sliced up this complex problem into smaller bits, prioritised them, and decided to concentrate on one bit at a time —in our case, business travel.

We then created a few hypotheses and a plan on how to validate them.

## Understanding the user

To tackle the problem, we, of course, needed some insights from real users, so ran a few quick and dirty interviews.

Targeting environmentally conscious professionals, we identified their habits, collected some stories from their working lives, and tried to understand their motivations around the topic. These exercises helped us to create two user profiles.
